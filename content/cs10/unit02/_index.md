This unit will focus on web applications and human-center design. Students will form teams focused on creating something for the ISF community. This could be a solution to a problem or a virtual experience for members of the community. 


## Act I: HTML (Django) and CSS (Bootstrap)

In this section of the project, students will become aquainted with Django and web programming. Teams will branch into two tracks, with one member learning the skills of a designer and the other learning
the skills of a web architect.

- *Designer Track:* this student will learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to make a build the front-end
interface of their team's project.
- *Architect Track:* This student will learn how to design, query, and maintain a database that will be used to
serve the content of their team's web app.

<!-- ### Milestone Event: Hackathon
This section of the project will culminate in a hackathon where students apply the technical skills 
they’ve learned to realize the web application they have designed for their project. This event will 
allow students to work on their projects in a supportive, collaborative environment. At the end of the
hackathon, teams will have a working version 1.0 of their applications, which they can continue testing 
and developing in the final section of the project. -->

## Act II: Introduction to Human-Centered Design

With a solid foundation to what Django has to offer, students will learn about the human-centered design and the basics of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). 

### Milestone Event: Pitch
After learning about the basics of human-centered design and forming the foundation of their projects, 
students will pitch their projects to a panel of “investors” composed of students, faculty, and staff 
members of the school. This event will require students to distill their project plans into easily 
digestible pitches and prepare quality prototypes, moving them forward in the process of developing 
their projects. Additionally, it will offer them a chance to get feedback from members of the community.

## Act III: Django Unchained and UI/UX

In the final section of the project, students will prepare the submission versions of their projects. To do this, students will learn about UI/UX design as they test and iterate on their web applications. Additionally, students will push their applications further and in individualized directions by learning to read Django documentation. This skill will allow students to develop features independent of the basic features demonstrated in Act II and will prepare students for life after cs10.


### Milestone Event: L(a)unch Event

To close out the project, teams will launch their web applications at a launch party. At the launch party, student teams will demo their applications in an expo format. This will be a chance for students to showcase their learning and to market their applications. =
