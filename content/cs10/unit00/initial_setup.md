## Ensure Xcode is Updated

{{< code-action "Copy and paste the command below into your Terminal to install Xcode." >}} Then press `Enter/Return`. Make sure you have a strong internet connection, this may take up to 2 hours to complete. Don't worry, you can still use your computer and have it running in the background. 

```shell
xcode-select --install
```


{{< code-action "Enter your password when prompted." >}} You won't see any letters appearing as you enter the password. This is a security feature.

{{< aside >}}
If you already have this installed, you will see the following message instead:
```shell
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

(If you closed the window, open Finder, click on "Applications," and then "Python 3.12" (or whatever version of Python you just installed).


(2) **Check Python installed successfully by typing `python --version` into the Terminal.** You should see a version number above `3.12`.

(3) **Double-click on "Install Certificates.command".** This will will open a Terminal window and run a bunch of commands. Once you see `[Process completed]`, you may close the window.

(4) **Double-click on "Update Shell Profile.command".** Each of these will open a Terminal window and run a bunch of commands. Once you see `[Process completed]`, you may close the window.

{{< aside >}}
**If you see a red "Permission denied" error message when running "Install Certificates.command"**:
- open a Terminal window and run **`sudo "/Applications/Python 3.12/Install Certificates.command"`**
- You will be asked for an administrator password; you won't see any letters appearing as you enter the password. This is a security feature.
