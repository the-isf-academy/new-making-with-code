# Review: Turtle Drawing

Welcome to Year 2 CS! We hope you're excited for what we have planned this year! 😄

Let's review by taking it back to Turtle drawings!

---

## [0] Set up

Now that you're in **Year 2** you need a new unit foler!

{{< code-action  >}} **Start by openning your Terminal!**

{{< code-action  >}} **In the Terminal, go into your `making_with_code` folder and create a `unit04_networking` folder.** If you no longer have a `making_with_code` folder, you will need to create one. 

```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code
mkdir unit04_networking
cd unit04_networking
```


{{< code-action "Then, clone your starter code." >}} Be sure to change `yourgithubusername` to your actual Github username.
> *remember: `tab` autocompletes in the Terminal*

```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_turtle_review_yourgithubusername
cd lab_turtle_review_yourgithubusername
```

{{< code-action >}} `cd` **into the lab**
```shell
cd lab_turtle_review_yourgithubusername
```


{{< aside "Windows Users" >}}

We suggest not copying the path command, and instead using `cd` and `ls` to ensure you are in the correct `making_with_code` folder.

{{< /aside >}}

{{< code-action "Install Tkinter" >}} We'll need this for our drawings.
```shell
brew install python-tk
```

{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry Shell." >}} Remember, we run this command at the start of each lab, but only when we are inside a lab folder.
```shell
poetry shell
```
{{< aside "Exiting the poetry shell" >}}
When you want to exit the shell, you can type `exit` or `^D`
{{< /aside >}}

## [1] Create a Turtle Drawing

{{< code-action "Run the Python file" >}} 
```shell
python turtle_drawing.py
```

{{< code-action "Open the code." >}} The `.` opens the entire folder.
```shell
code . 
```

{{< code-action >}} **Using the starter code in `turtle_drawing.py` create a drawing that includes at least 3 of CS concepts below:**

- [Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp)
- [Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)
- [Conditionals](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)
- [Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)
- [Dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)
