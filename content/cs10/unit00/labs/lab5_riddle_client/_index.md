# Client

In this lab we will create a Client in the form of a Command Line Interface(CLI) for the Riddle server. We will use the `Requests` library to send and recieve HTTP requests. To learn more about the `Requests` library, checkout its [documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## [0] What is a client?


Since the riddle server is an API with no user interface, we end up writing a lot of
HTTP requests into the Terminal to use it. What if we had a program which took care
of making these requests for us? A program like this is called a *client*.

**Any app which uses the Internet is a client.**

{{< figure src=https://res.cloudinary.com/lwgatsby/f_auto/www/uploads/2023/05/client-server-network.jpg" width="50%">}}


The client, or app, is constantly making HTTP requests to a server to send and receive information.

### Riddle API Refresher

🌐 **Visit [http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all](http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all) to view riddle server.**

💻 **As a reminder, you can make `GET` and `POST` requests to the API using the `httpie` tool**
```shell
http get http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all
```

```shell
http post http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/guess id=1 guess="pickles" 
```

Here is a cheatsheet of the Riddle endpoints, what parameters they take in their payload, and what they do:

| Method | URL                                | Required Payload     | Action                                                                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/riddle/all`   |                      | Returns a list of all the riddles, without answers.                                      |
| `GET`  | `/riddle/one`   | `id`                 | Returns the riddle if it exists. (Otherwise, it returns an error with status code 404.)  |
| `GET`  | `/riddle/difficulty`   | `id`                 | Returns the riddle if it exists with its difficulty score. (Otherwise, it returns an error with status code 404.)  |
| `POST` | `/riddle/new`   | `question`, `answer` | Creates a new riddle (with an automatically-assigned id). Returns the riddle.            |
| `POST` | `/riddle/guess` | `id`, `guess`        | Checks whether the guess is correct. In the response, `correct` is `True` or `False`.    |

### riddle_client.py

The `RiddleClient` class controls the `HTTP requests` to the [Riddle Server](http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all). It uses the [Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to send `GET` and `POST` requests. 

It has one properties:

| Property      | Description                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **riddle_server** | stores the url of the riddle server             |

And the following methods:

| Method                          | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **view_all_riddles()**              | GETS all of the riddles and prints them as a bulleted list       |
| **guess_riddle(user_chosen_id, user_guess)** | GETS one riddle with the requested ID                            |


--- 

### `all_riddles()`

👀 **First let's look at the method`all_riddles()`** that sends an **HTTP GET** request to the Riddle server endpoint `riddles/all`.

```python {linenos=inline}
def all_riddles(self):
        '''This functions sends a GET request to riddles/all.'''

        # stores the full address for /all
        all_riddles_address = self.riddle_server + 'all'

        # makes HTTP GET request 
        response = requests.get(all_riddles_address)

        # checks if request is successful
        if response.status_code == 200:

            # stores the response JSON
            all_riddles_json = response.json()

            parsed_riddle_list = []

            for riddle_dict in all_riddles_json['riddles']:
                parsed_riddle_list.append( f"{riddle_dict['id']}# {riddle_dict['question']}")

            # returns the list of riddles 
            return parsed_riddle_list

        else:     
            # returns HTTP error code, if request is unsuccessful
            return f"HTTP error {response.status_code}"
```
- `line 5:` stores the full URL address of where to get all of the riddles. It uses the `riddle_server` property of the client class as the base address and adds the endpoint to the end of it.
- `line 8:` sends an HTTP GET request to the server and stores the response.
- `lines 11-22:` If the HTTP request was sucessful, it parses the JSON
  - `line 14:` converts the response from the server into JSON.
  - `line 16-22:` returns a list of nicely formmated riddles with the id and question
- `line 12-13`: If the HTTP request was unsuccessful, return the error status code

### `guess_riddle()`

👀 **Now, let's look at the method`guess_riddle()`** that sends an **HTTP POST** request to the Riddle server endpoint `riddle/guess`.


```python {linenos=inline}
def guess_riddle(self, user_chosen_id, user_guess):
        '''This function sends a POST request to riddles/guess.'''

        # stores the full address for /guess
        guess_riddles_address = self.riddle_server + 'guess'

        # stores the payload in a dictionary
        payload = {
            'id': user_chosen_id,
            'guess': user_guess
        }

        # makes HTTP POST request with the payload
        response = requests.post(guess_riddles_address, json=payload)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            guess_riddle_json = response.json()

            # parse response JSON
            if 'riddle' in guess_riddle_json:
                parsed_messaged = ""

                if guess_riddle_json['riddle']['correct'] == True:
                    parsed_messaged = 'Correct!!!'

                else:
                    parsed_messaged = 'Incorrect ;('

                return parsed_messaged

            else:
                return guess_riddle_json['error']

        else:
            return f"HTTP error {response.status_code}"
```
- `line 5:` stores the full URL address of where to get one riddle.
- `lines 8-11:` stores the payload in a dictionary.
- `line 14` sends an HTTP POST request with the payload to the server and stores the response.
- `lines 16-32` If the HTTP request was sucessful, it parses the JSON
  - `line 17` - get the json from the HTTP request
  - `line 21` - creates a variable to store the parsed message
  - `line 22-19` - checks if the guess was correct or incorrect and returns an appropraite message
  - `line 21-32` - returns error JSON
- `line 22-23`: If the HTTP request was unsuccessful, return the error status code

## [4] Extend the Client

💻 **Your job is to add 2 methods to the `riddle_client.py`.** 
- `view_one_riddle()`
  - allows the user to input a riddle id 
  - if riddle exists, return specific information for the given riddle
  - returns the specific information for the given riddle
- `new_riddle()` 
  - allows the user to input a riddle question and answer
  - if riddle was added, return a success message 


📄 **For each new functionality, you will need to edit:**
- `riddle_client.py`
- `test_riddle_client.py`


{{< aside "Test File" >}}

✅ Use the test file to check your methods return appropriate message for each use case. 

- is the success message correct? 
- is the error message appropriate? *(try sending a riddle id that does not exist)*
- what if there is an HTTP error? *(try sending incorrect parameters, like a string as an id)*

{{< /aside >}}

### A few tips


🐞 **Debugging**
- Test, test, test! Make sure you are confident in each piece before moving on. 
- Use `print()` statements CONSTANTLY to give yourself more information 
- Copy and Paste are your best friends

📚 **Parsing JSON**

The HTTP response is given to us in `JSON`.  

JSON is a standardized format to transfer data over a network. It represents data in a key/value pair, just like a Python dictionary.

**You can parse JSON, just as you would a [Python dictionary](https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/).**

💡 *What is in the `JSON` response if the guess is correct? If the guess is incorrect?*
