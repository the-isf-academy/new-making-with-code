## [0] Project Planning Document

This is a big project, and you will get lost or frustrated if you don't do some planning up front.
Before you start working on your project, you are required to complete the Project Planning Sheet and meet with a teacher.

‚úèÔ∏è **Fill out your project planning sheet.**

‚úã **Meet with a teacher to discuss your idea before beginning to code.**

{{< aside "A few ideas to build on from last year's projects:" >}}

- collaborative story telling (each person adds a new word to a collaborative story)
- r/place, but with emojis or symbols 
- collaborative counting game like [this IRL game](https://dramaresource.com/count-to-20/#:~:text=Sit%20or%20stand%20in%20a,start%20again%20from%20the%20beginning.)
- collaborative hangman

## [1] Starter Code

{{< code-action "Add a shortcut command to easily open Github" >}} 
```shell
echo 'alias remote="open \"\$(git remote get-url origin | sed \"s/\.git\$//\")\""' >> ~/.zshrc
```


{{< code-action "Download your repository with starter code for your project." >}} Be sure to change `yourgithubusername` to your actual Github username.

```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/unit03_networking/
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_networking_backend_yourgithubusername.git
cd project_networking_project_networking_backend_yourgithubusername
```

{{< code-action "Enter the poetry shell." >}}
```shell
poetry shell
```

{{< code-action "Install requirements" >}}
```shell
poetry update
```

<!-- {{< code-action "Install Banjo" >}}
```shell
pip3 install django-banjo
``` -->

The `project_networking` repository containing the following:
  - `\app`
    - `models.py` - This is where you will define your model.
    - `views.py` - This is where you will define your routes and endpoints.
  - `settings.py` - This is where you define your `BASE_URL`
  - `database.sqlite` - This is your database file.
  - `README.md` - This is documentation for the backend of your project.

{{< code-action "Start coding your first milestone!" >}} With you project management sheet approved by a teacher and your starter code downloaded, you're ready to start creating.

- documentation [3]

**For each criteria you will be assessed on a score from 0-3. With 8 criteria, there is a total of 24 potential points.** 
- 0 - no evidence of the practice
- 1 - limited evidence of the practice
- 2 - adequate evidence of the practice
- 3 - substantial evidence of the practice
