## [0] Project Overview

🎨 **Design Brief:** In this project, you must create a personal website to showcase yourself. It is up to you to decide how to best express yourself and implement that vision. 

It should include at least one of the following:

- personal achievements *(e.g. academic, athletic, artistic, etc.)*
- hobbies and/or interests *(e.g. culture you identify with: games, movies, music, art, etc. )*
- examples/links to personal projects *(e.g. artwork, photography, music, writing, recipes)*
- a portrait of yourself *(e.g. photography, drawing, cartoon, etc.)*


**Your personal website must include:**
- `.html` files
    - `index.html` homepage
- `styles.css` file
- `media`
    - this may include images or videos to showcase yourself or your work
    - you may include these in `/assets` or link them via the web
- `README.md` - here you will keep a works cited list with a short description of how you used the resource

You may use and adapt code you find online. However, you must keep track of the resources you used with a short description of how you used it. We will not help you debug huge lines of code you find online and do not understand.

## [1] Design Specification


✏️ **You will use a miro board to plan your website before you build it. The purpose of this board is to outline your design specifications and justify any changes to the design over time**


If your design specs change over time, that's okay! Just be sure to document what you changed and why you changed it on your Miro board

💻 **Duplicate the [Miro Board Template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNyV3moc=/?share_link_id=540296233857) and share it with the teachers.**
> 1) Click `Web Design Design Specification Document [template]` on the top left 
> 2) Click `Duplicate`
> 3) Share with `eqbrown@isf.edu.hk` and `bgenzlinger@isf.edu.hk`

## [2] Starter Code

You have the option of hosting your site online using Github pages. Because of this, you will need to create a new repository from a *template* of  the repository into your personal Github account. 

{{< code-action "Follow along with the teacher to ensure you properly create a template of the repository: " >}} [https://github.com/the-isf-academy/emmaqbrown.github.io](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/emmaqbrown.github.io).
> - Select `Use this template`
> - Select `Create a new repository`
> - Name the repository: `yourgithubusername.github.io` *(e.g. emmaqbrown.github.io)*
> - Select `Private` or `Public` (if you want your site to be live on the web, it must be `Public`)
> - Select `Create repository from template`

{{< code-action "Add the teachers to your  personal repository as a collaborators." >}}
> - Select `Settings`
> - Select `Collaborators and teams`
> - Selected `Add people`
> - Add `emmaqbrown` and `brittegenzlinger` as Admin

{{< code-action "Clone the repository into your" >}} `cs10/unit01_webdesign` folder. 

👀 **The repository contains the following:**
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `/assets` - you should put in photos into folder 
- `README.md` - keep this up to date with the resources you reference

🌐 **If you would like for your project to be live on the web, you must activate Github pages**. Every time you push your Github, it will automatically push your website live to: `yourgithubername.github.io`. For example, this site is is hosted at:[https://the-isf-academy.github.io/making-with-code/](https://the-isf-academy.github.io/making-with-code/).
> - Select `Settings` on the repo page
> - Select `Pages` on the left sidebar
> - Select `Branch` > `main` > `Save`

## [5] Resources

🔍 **Google is your best friend!** Especially when it comes to Web Design, it's not about remembering exact HTML syntax or hundreds of specific CSS properties. It's about coming up with a design and figuring out how to implement it by looking at examples and modifying existing code.
