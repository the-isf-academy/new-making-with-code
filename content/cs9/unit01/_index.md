## Programming:
This unit is an introduction to data structures. It focuses on learning these data types: `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `list`, and `dictionary`, and using skills such as iterating and reorganizing large datasets. This unit also introduces the idea of `return` in functions. Students will continue building on skills learned in Unit 00. 
Curriculum: Based on introductory unit from BJC.

## Problem sets
Write basic functions to perform calculations on numbers and lists. Biggest, smallest, mean, median, mode, quartiles, etc.

<!-- ## Labs
Lab 0 : introduction to datatypes, google colab, and returning. 
Lab 1: Students will write code to plot histograms, scatter plots, and the line of best fit. Lab 2: Students will be introduced to the basics of Pandas and matplotlib, the standard Python libraries for data analysis and plotting. -->

## Project
Collect some data or use an existing dataset. Frame a research question and use the data to answer it.
