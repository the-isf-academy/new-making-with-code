## Programming:
Introduction to functional programming; abstraction. Types: int, float, bool. Introduction to data structures. Iterating over lists. Students will build on code reuse from unit 1, this time writing functions without side effects that can be composed. Curriculum: Based on introductory unit from BJC.

## Problem sets
Write basic functions to perform calculations on numbers and lists. Biggest, smallest, mean, median, mode. Quartiles. Scale, clamp, bin.

## Labs
Lab 1: Students will write code to plot histograms, scatter plots, and the line of best fit. Lab 2: Students will be introduced to the basics of Pandas and matplotlib, the standard Python libraries for data analysis and plotting.

## Project
Collect some data or use an existing dataset. Frame a research question and use the data to answer it.
