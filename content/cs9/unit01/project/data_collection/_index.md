# Data Collection Guides

From the left menu, select whichever service you would like to analyze! Then, follow the instructions to download your data. The downloads from Spotify and Youtube may take up to 30 days before you can download them.

Once you've successfully downloaded your data, upload it to your Google Drive.

<!-- Now that you've got your data, let's build it out and add more columns. 

{{< code-action "Start by cloning this repository into your folder." >}} This repository contains Python scripts to build out the database for each service.
```shell
cd desktop/cs9/unit_01
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data.git
```

> This repository's file system looks like this, with each service having its own folder.
> ```shell
> .
> ├── README.md
> ├── imessage_export
> ├── netflix_export
> ├── whatsapp_export
> ├── spotify_export
> ├── youtube_export
> ```

{{< code-action >}}  **`cd` into the folder for the service you choose.** 
Here you will see:
- a `requirements.txt` file
- a `/data` folder
- a `/export` folder 
- Python script(s)

{{< code-action "Install the necessary requirements inside the service_export folder:" >}}
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

{{< look-action >}} **Then, open the link to the README.md for your specific service. The README.md contains step by step instructions for how to build out your dataset.**
- [Netflix](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/netflix_export) 
- [Spotify](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/spotify_export)
- [Whatsapp](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/whatsapp_export)
- [YouTube](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/youtube_export)

{{< code-action "Follow along with the README.md file." >}} If successful, your dataset `.csv` file will be in the `/export` folder.
> *Please notify a teacher if you run into any issues and do not see your dataset.* -->
