# Unit 01 Data Science Project

The final project for this unit will be a research project. Working with the data science tools we explored this unit, **you are expected to tell a narrative story about a time in your life using data as evidence.** 

To be successful in this project, you should **find a topic that is both interesting to you and answerable** (at least in part) with data from your chosen dataset. Your teachers will help you make sure your project hypothesis achieves that.

## [1] Timeline

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Firstly, you will plan your project and choose a research question.**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Secondly, you will conduct the data analysis and create data visusalizations.**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Thirdly, you will create a research poster to communicate your finding.**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Fourthly, you will present your findings to the class.**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Lastly, if interested, you may present your findings at Shuyuan Research Week in May.**  This is not required.

## [2] Starter Materials

{{< code-action >}} **You can find your project in your Google Drive:** `Project: Data Science.ipynb`

‚úèÔ∏è **For the poster, you may use Canva or any other service.** It will be A3 size.

## [3] Assessment

‚úÖ **The assessment is broken down into four criteria:**
- Project Planning  
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualizations 
- Data Communication Communication


**For each criteria you will be assigned a score from 0-3:**
- 0 - no to no evidence of the concept
- 1 - limited evidence of the concept
- 2 - adequate evidence of the concept
- 3 - substantial evidence of the concept
<!-- 
{{< expand "Scoring Breakdown" >}}

The project is scored out of 7. 

*To calculate your score for the practices & concepts, look at the following bands:*

- 0 = 0
- 1 = 1
- 2 = 2-3
- 3 = 4-5
- 4 = 6-7
- 5 = 8-11
- 6 = 12-13
- 7 = 14-15

## [4] Success Claims

üíØ **Successful computer scientists should be able to make the following claims:**
- Project Planning 
    - I can brainstorm potential areas of exploration with my data 
    - I can choose a relevant research question and break it down into sub-questions 
    - I can consistently track my progress with notes and comments
- Data Analysis  
    - I can combine and reorganize pieces of data to explore new relationships
    - I can generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, frequency count) for describing the data
- Data Visualization 
    - I can chooose appropriate data visaulizations to communicate my findings 
    - I can display data visualizations that are thoughtfully sorted and easy to read
- Data Communication Communication: Poster & Presentation 
    - I can explain the purpose and focus of the research 
    - I can explain my methodology, including action steps and reasoning for restructuring the data
    - I can reflect on the meaning of the data and provide context of the results
    - I can discuss the limitations and potential biases of my data and analysis 
    - I can consider potential future areas of investigation if I were to continue this project

**Keep the success claims in mind when coding your project.**
