# Welcome to CS 9

This is a high-level overview of the curricular units that comprise this introductory course.


{{< expand "Unit 0: Drawing" >}}

### Unit 0: Drawing
This initial unit prioritizes getting students making personally-meaningful things as fast as
possible. This means we aren’t aiming for completeness. In particular, we’re not introducing 
data structures in this unit; most students won’t need them, and we’ll spend a lot of time with
them in the next unit.

Working within the context of drawing, students practice building up complex programs from simple
ones. We’ll use Python’s turtle library. Loosely inspired by Chris’s Python drawing unit from GMS.

Programming:
- Imperative programming
- Basics of syntax
- Control flow: sequences, loops, conditionals, functions
- Levels of abstraction: functions, modules
- Decomposition and code reuse.
- Introductory debugging strategies.

#### Labs
Each cycle will contain 3 labs with core content designed to last 80 minutes and extension
content. Class sessions in each cycle will be chunked into an 80 minute session and two 135
minute sessions. This should allow all students ample time to complete the core content of
each of the three labs in a cycle while providing extension content to students who complete 
the labs more quickly.

#### Check-ins
Check-ups will serve the purpose of reviewing past content and preparing for future content.
After each lab, students will complete a check-in question to check their understanding of 
a practice or concept covered in the lab. These will usually be code-based problems like
asking students to create various drawing primitives. Additionally, some check-ups will
ask students to do preparatory work like finding pieces of art they like or identifying
patterns in the world.

#### Project
Create some personally-meaningful drawing. First, a draft will be due with a sketch of the
final project and some planning, including planned subroutines and pseudocode. Each drawing
project should highlight the unique opportunities of computational art by utilizing repeated 
patterns, abstract designs, customization, and/or user/viewer interaction.

{{< expand "Unit 1: Data Science" >}}

Programming: Introduction to functional programming; abstraction. Types: int, float, bool. Introduction to data structures. Iterating over lists. Students will build on code reuse from unit 1, this time writing functions without side effects that can be composed. Curriculum: Based on introductory unit from BJC.

#### Homework

Write basic functions to perform calculations on numbers and lists. Biggest, smallest, mean, median, mode. Quartiles. Scale, clamp, bin.

#### Labs

Lab 1: Students will write code to plot histograms, scatter plots, and the line of best fit.
Lab 2: Students will be introduced to the basics of Pandas and matplotlib, the standard Python libraries for data analysis and plotting.

#### Project

Collect some data or use an existing dataset. Frame a research question and use the data to answer it.

### Unit 2: Games

Games and other interactive media are some of the most important texts of the digital age. We will play and discuss several games, discussing how they work technically and drawing on theoretical perspectives to talk about how they create meaningful experiences for the player. Programming: prototyping, decomposition of larger problems, incremental & iterative development of larger projects.

#### Homework

Learning how games work can be a great spur toward imagining new ones. This unit’s problem sets will be focused on implementing simple game mechanics.

#### Labs

Lab 1: Using the Arcade platformer tutorial, program a maze game.
Lab 2: Write an algorithm to procedurally-generate random mazes to initialize the maze game.
There will also be ad-hoc mini-labs based on what students need for their games. Likely candidates are gravity, inventories, simulating perspective, animation techniques.

#### Project

Create a game that matters, perhaps as part of a group. This will be very open-ended, but students will be required to submit a substantial proposal, including a game concept with some evidence of prototyping and iteration; wireframes of the game interface; decomposition of tasks and who plans to work on what.
