# Conditionals
In this lab, we'll introduce a new concept: conditionals. This allows change  the behavior of our code based on context.

## [0] Conditional behavior

There are many situations where you change your behavior based on the environment. For example, if it is raining outside, you wear rain boots. Otherwise, you might wear a different kind of shoe like tennis shoes.

You probably have even more complicated environmental responses as well.

**For example, if you are ordering bubble tea, your order might go like this:**
* If the shop has taro,
    * you get taro in your tea
* If the shop doesn't have taro but has pearl
    * you get pearl in your tea
* Finally, in the case that the shop doesn't have taro or pearl
    * you don't order any bubble tea.

In computer science, **we call this kind of behavior `conditional`**: your code runs only in the case that some condition is satisfied.

## [1] Set up
<!-- 
{{< code-action "Start by opening the Terminal cloning this lab onto your laptop." >}} As a reminder, we will run this command at the start of each lab.
```shell
mwc update
```
{{< code-action "In the Terminal, type the following command to open the lab folder." >}}
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs9/unit00_drawing/lab_conditionals
``` -->

Due to an issue with the `mwc` tool, you will clone this lab manually. 

{{< code-action >}} **Start by going into your `unit00_drawing` folder.**
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs9/unit00_drawing/
```
{{< code-action "Then clone the lab" >}}
```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_conditionals.git
```

{{< code-action "Now that you have the lab, go into its folder." >}}
```shell
cd lab_conditionals
```

{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry Shell to start the lab." >}} As a reminder, we will run this command at the start of each lab, but only when we are inside a lab folder.
```shell
poetry shell
```
{{< aside "Exiting the poetry shell" >}}
When you want to exit the shell, you can type `exit` or `^D`
{{< /aside >}}

{{< code-action "Take a look at the files inside with:" >}} `ls`
- `conditionals_example.py`
- `conditionals_modulo.py`
- `conditionals_pattern.py`
- `conditionals_rainbow.py`
- `conditionals_user_input.py`

### [Conditions]
**In computer science, conditions are binary. They are either `True` or `False`, never in-between.** To create these conditions, we can use comparison operators to compare values.

{{< code-action "Guess what condition the following comparisions will evaluate to." >}}  You
can test your guesses by typing these conditions into the Python shell.

{{< code-action >}} **To enter a Python shell, just type `python` into your terminal.**
> *To exit the Python shell type: `^d`*

```python
2 < 3
```

```python
2 == 3
```

```python
"Gold" == "Silver"
```

```python
"Gold" == "Gold"
```
{{< code-action >}}**Using the Python shell to experiment with the following comparison operators.** You will be asked to evaulate expression in the deliverables form.
- `<`
- `>`
- `==`
- `<=`
- `>=`
- `!=`
> *For example try: `10 == '10`.*

## [2] Writing Conditionals
Using the conditions generated by comparison operators, you can conditionally execute pieces of your code. This is useful for changing what your code does to respond to different conditions
of the program.

### [if statements]
`if` **statements are the beginning to every conditional code block.** The code written inside the code block that follows only runs if the condition after the `if` evaluates to `True`.

```python
for i in range(20):
    if i < 10:
        print("Smaller than 10")
```

### [else statements]
`else` **statements** can be paired with `if` statements to create an alternative block of code to **execute if the condition after the `if` evaluates to `False`.**

What is the difference between the following two programs?


```python
# [else: example 1]
for i in range(20):
    if i < 10:
        print("Smaller than 10")
    print("Greater than or equal to 10")
```

```python
# [else: example 2]
for i in range(20):
    if i < 10:
        print("Smaller than 10")
    else:
        print("Greater than or equal to 10")
```


### [elif statements]
Finally, `elif` **statements** ("else if") can be used to **create multiple branches of a conditional.** These statements add another condition to check if the condition above them does not pass.

The following program creates three branches of execution:

```python
for i in range(20):
    if i < 10:
        print("Smaller than 10")
    elif i < 15:
        print("Greater than 9 but less than 15")
    else:
        print("Greater than or equal to 15")
```

This conditional creates the following cases for the variable `i`:

- i < 10
- 10 <= i < 15
- 15 <= i


{{< code-action "Run the following file to see this conditional statement in action:" >}} `conditionals_example.py`.
```shell
python conditionals_example.py
```


{{< code-action "Open the code in:" >}} `conditionals_example.py`.
```shell
atom conditionals_example.py
```

{{< code-action "Experiment with changing the conditional statements." >}} Then run your code to see how your changes affect what it prints.

## [3] Conditionals: User Input

Now, let's explore how we can use conditionals in conjunction with user input.

{{< code-action "Start by running the file:" >}} `conditionals_user_input.py`. One way to use conditionals in our drawings is to use them to respond to user input.
> *Try asking the program to draw a square.*
```shell
python conditionals_user_input.py
```

{{< code-action "Now, let's open up the code." >}}
```shell
atom conditionals_user_input.py
```

```python
######################
# Unit 0 Lab 4
# conditionals_user_input.py
#######################

from turtle import *

while True:

    drawing = input("What would you like me to draw? ")
    size = int(input("How big should I draw it? "))
    if drawing == "square":
        for i in range(4):
            forward(size)
            right(90)
    elif drawing == "quit":
        break
    else:
        print("Sorry, I don't know how to draw that...")

    clear()
```
> *`while True:` just prevents the program from ending after one loop*


This program has a lot of potential, but so far it can only generate one drawing.

{{< code-action "Add at least two more branches to the conditional so that the program can draw more than just a square." >}}  An `elif` statement will probably be useful here.
> For example, your program could draw a square, a triangle, and a circle.

## [4] Modulo

Python has many operators that allow you to perform calculations with values. You've probably
seen and used the basic ones like `+`(add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), and `/` (divide).

However, Python has some other less common opertors that can be really helpful.

One such operator is **the modulo operator** (`%`). This operator **takes two values, divides them, and returns the remainder of the division.**
> For example:
>
> 5/2 has a remainder of 1
>
> `5%2` = 1

{{< code-action >}} **Open and run the file `conditionals_modulo.py` to experiment with the `modulo` operator.** Does it output what you expected?
```python
print(5%2)
print(3%3)
print(6%2)
print(9%2)
```

---

### [Even/Odd Pattern]

Conditionals can also be paired with the modulo operator to cause your code to run in repeated
patterns.

{{< code-action "Start by running" >}} `conditional_pattern.py`. You should see a series of red boxes.
```shell
python conditionals_pattern.py
```

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/00_conditionals_pattern0.png" width=40% alt-text="Pattern created by conditionals" >}}

{{< code-action "Edit the code so uses the modulo operator to create an alternating pattern of red and blue boxes." >}}
> One common use of the `modulo` operator, is to determine if a number is even or odd. Use that in conjunction with conditional statements to create an alternating color pattern.

## [6] Extension: Rainbow

{{< code-action "Start by running" >}} `conditionals_rainbow.py`. You should see a series of colored boxes in a rainbow - very similar to the previous program.
```shell
python conditionals_rainbow.py
```

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/00_conditionals_rainbow1.png" width=50% alt-text="rainbow pattern of boxes" >}}


{{< code-action "Open up the code and see how it works" >}} `conditionals_rainbow.py`. As you can see the code is over 80 lines long!
```shell
atom conditionals_rainbow.py
```
> Although this code is really really long, there is a pattern to the rainbow that we could use
to simplify the code!

{{< code-action "Simplify this code using conditional statements and the modulo operator." >}} Your file should be less than 40 lines of code when successfully simplified.

<!--
You've seen a great example of modulo being used to select the color of a drawing. Now you can use your newfound knowledge!

{{< code-action "Incorporate the modulo operator into your geometric sequence visualization or your fibonacci visualization from the previous lab.">}} If you didn't get a chance to create a visualization of the geometric sequence last class, now is your opportunity!

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/fibonacci-modulo.png" alt-text="Fibonacci + Modulo" >}} -->
