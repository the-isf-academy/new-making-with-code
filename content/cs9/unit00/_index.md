#### Labs
Each cycle will contain 3 labs with core content designed to last 80 minutes and extension
content. Class sessions in each cycle will be chunked into an 80 minute session and two 135
minute sessions. This should allow all students ample time to complete the core content of
each of the three labs in a cycle while providing extension content to students who complete
the labs more quickly.

#### Do Nows
Do Nows will provide quick challenges for the students to complete at the beginning of class.
These challenges introduce or reinforce various coding skills such as
code tracing, error literacy, troubleshooting, and other debugging skills.

#### Project
Create some personally-meaningful drawing. First, a draft will be due with a sketch of the
final project and some planning, including planned subroutines and pseudocode. Each drawing
project should highlight the unique opportunities of computational art by utilizing repeated
patterns, abstract designs, customization, and/or user/viewer interaction.
