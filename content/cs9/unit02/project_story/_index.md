# Unit 02 Games: Story Project

🎨 **Design Prompt:** You will create a text-based game inspired by a real piece of media or your own life. 

{{< code-action >}} **Your game must include one unique feature.** For example:


It is totally up to you what type of story you make. For example you could make:
- choose your own adventure game 
- exploration game
- puzzle game 
- narrative story game

> [*Zork*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) is often noted as one of the best video games of all time.

>*"What Zork seemed to contribute more than anything was the idea that the computer could simulate a rich virtual environment" - [Matt Barton](https://web.archive.org/web/20220809014122/https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/the-history-of-zork)*

## [0] Planning Document

This is a big project with a lot of room for customization. It is important for you to plan the game prior to coding. 

**✏️ Plan your game in your Google Doc:**  `Unit 02: Games  - Story Project Planning Document`. *Check with a teacher before moving on to the code.*

You will need to:<br>
1️⃣ plan the implementation of an additional feature <br>
2️⃣ outline your story in a graph diagram 

🧠 Some idea for features:
- branches that come back together into the same Node
- ability to go back to a previous node
- some nodes send you back to the beginning
- time limit - user must make a choice quickly, OR ELSE
- auding audio or images to nodes
- variable messaging in the story associated with user actions
    - *e.g. "you have visited this store 5 times"*
- a Player() class with unique properties
    - *e.g. hunger, money, or health*
- adding enemies to the game
- certain nodes or parts of the story give you items
    - *e.g. a locked door where you need to first collect the key in a certain room.*

<!-- **For each criteria you will be assessed on a score from 0-3. With 5 criteria, there is a total of 15 potential points.** 
- 0 - no evidence of the practice
- 1 - limited evidence of the practice
- 2 - adequate evidence of the practice
- 3 - substantial evidence of the practice

{{< expand "Scoring Breakdown" >}}

The project is scored out of 15. 

*To calculate your score for the practices & concepts, look at the following bands:*

- 1 = 0
- 2 = 1
- 3 = 2-3
- 4 = 4-6
- 5 = 7-11
- 6 = 12-13
- 7 = 14-15

## [4] Resources

### 👾 Games for inspiration
**If you need inspiration, explore these narrative games.** As you play, consider the different genres and what's possible with this structure. 
- [Harry Potter - Sorting Hat](https://unfold.studio/stories/303/)
- [Oregon Trail 1971](https://unfold.studio/stories/10782/)
- [City Exploration](https://unfold.studio/stories/2649/)
- [Store front Example, variables](https://unfold.studio/stories/1065/)

### ✏️ AI tools
If you need help writing the text, feel free to use an AI service. Just be sure to cite your transcript in the Planning Doc.
- [poe](https://poe.com/)
- [rytr](https://rytr.me/)
- [composeai](https://www.compose.ai/#:~:text=Compose%20AI%20is%20a%20free,some%20of%20our%20personalization%20features.)

### 👀 Readability
Here are a few resources that may help improve readability.
- [Emojis](https://www.emojicopy.com/)
- [InquirerPy](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - This is the package that controls the menu
- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
    - This package adds colors to the print statements in the Terminal

---

###  🔉 Play Sound
If you are interested in including sounds in your game, follow along with these steps.

(0) **Install the playsound library:** `pip3 install playsound`

(1) **Add a sound file to your repository.** *e.g. .mp3, .m4a, .wav file.*
> If will have multiple sounds, be sure to consider how you will organize your repostiory.

(2) **Incorporate the sound into your game.** If this is your feature, I highly planning how you will incorporate this into the `Node()`, `Story()` and/or `game.py`.

```python
from playsound import playsound

playsound('test_sound.m4a')
```

---

### 🌄 Open Images

If you are interested in including images in your game, follow along with these steps. It will open the image in your computer's default image viewer *(e.g. Preview)*.

(0) **Install the playsound library:** `poetry add pillow`

(1) **Add a image file to your repository.** *e.g. .png, .jpg file*
> If will have multiple images, be sure to consider how you will organize your repository.

(2) **Incorporate the image into your game.** If this is your feature, I highly planning how you will incorporate this into the `Node()`, `Story()` and/or `game.py`.


```python
from PIL import Image

image1 = Image.open(r"test_img.png") 
image1.show()
```

---

###  ⏱ Time
If you are interested in including an element of time in your game (a countdown, a stopwatch, etc.), follow along with these steps. You can also reference `lab_typing_game` which used the `time()` to calculate wpm.

**Be sure to import the time library and any functions you want to use at the top of the file.** 

**`time()`**  - *save the current time into a variable*
```python
from time import time

#save the current time
current_time = time()
```

**`sleep()`** - *pause your program for a given amount of seconds.*
```python
from time import sleep

#pause program for 3 seconds
sleep(3)
```

### 🌄 ASCII Art

ASCII Art is low-fi art that will print directly in the Terminal. For example...

```
 |\    o
    |  \    o
|\ /    .\ o
| |       (
|/ \     /
    |  /
     |/
```

💻 **The code for this looks like:**
```python
print("""\
     |\    o
    |  \    o
|\ /    .\ o
| |       (
|/ \     /
    |  /
     |/
""")
```
> *Note the `"""\` at the start and the `"""` and the end of the print statement*

🌐 **Here are a few links to find and create your own ascii art.** Just be sure to site what you use in your `README.md`
- [asciiart.eu/](https://www.asciiart.eu/)
